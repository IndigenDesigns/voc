# Voc

A physical model of the vocal tract, based on
[pink trombone](https://dood.al/pinktrombone/)

More information can be found on the main
[Voc webpage](http://pbat.ch/proj/voc).

Things you'll need:

- CWEB (this often comes with TeX)
- [Soundpipe (dev branch)](http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/soundpipe.git)
- [Sporth](http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/sporth.git) (somewhat optional)
- sporth_tex (can be installed with Sporth by running "make sporth_tex" in the
sporth codebase)
- GNUplot (needed to generate visuals)

Running "make" with no arguments will run ctangle.
The core files generated are
*voc.c* and *voc.h*. These can more or less be dropped into a working project
and it will behave like any other soundpipe module. The exception to this is
that you will need to use setter and getter functions to set and retrieve
parameters in Voc. Some of these examples can be found inside the generated
Voc document.

## Sound examples

The videos below showcase Voc being used in a musical context. The sounds
were synthesized using Sporth and the Sporth plugin implementation of Voc.

- [Babble](https://vimeo.com/220091107): The first real patch created in Sporth
using Voc was *Babble*. *Babble* makes good use of interpolated random number
generators and jitter to produce sounds that mimic a babbling person.

- [Chant](https://vimeo.com/220091290): The patch *Chant* was an attempt to
build a constrasting patch to *Babble*, this time focusing on slow moving periodic
modulations instead of fast and
random ones. Voc is able to turn into something resembling a chanting
monk by picking a low fundamental frequency, a high velum, low frequency
sinusoidal modulation of the position, as well as a high diameter parameter.
A lowend boost and reverb is added to taste.

- [Unya](https://vimeo.com/220091487):
This was an attempt to find interesting values from the tongue control
parameters, as well as build something tonal. Both *diameter* and *position*
are mapped to clocked envelope generators, which have the effect of going
between two vowel states. In this case, they make a sound which approximates
the nonsensical word "unya".

## Realtime Demo

For those wishing to try out Voc with minimum hassle, there is a
realtime [voc demo](https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/voc_demo) which
is able to compile for both Mac OSX and Linux systems running JACK. This
demo uses the version of Voc contained inside of
[Soundpipe](https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/soundpipe).

## Licensing

Voc has a multi-licensing scheme for the different components:

- The core CWEB code uses the MIT license.
- The code generated by ctangle (voc.c, voc.h, etc...) is released under
the public domain.
- The TeX code generated by cweave, and any resulting documents generated
using that code such as the PDF, are released on the Creative Commons
Attribution ShareAlike license.
- The included Sporth code examples are all public domain
